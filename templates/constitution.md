# Project Constitution - Spec Kit Assistant Integration

## Methodology

This project follows the **Spec Kit Assistant** methodology, an enhanced version of GitHub's Spec-Driven Development that provides AI-guided specification creation, technical planning, task breakdown, and quality analysis.

## Workflow Integration

### Phase Progression
1. **Specification** (`/ska-start`) - AI-assisted requirements gathering
2. **Planning** (`/ska-plan`) - Technical architecture development  
3. **Task Breakdown** (`/ska-tasks`) - Actionable development tasks
4. **Analysis** (`/ska-analyze`) - Quality assessment and validation

### Compatibility with GitHub Spec Kit
- Maintains full compatibility with `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks` commands
- Enhances spec-kit workflow with AI-guided exploration
- Preserves spec-kit artifacts and directory structure
- Integrates seamlessly with existing `.specify/` workflows

## Quality Standards

### Specification Requirements
- All features must have comprehensive specifications before implementation
- User journeys mapped with edge cases identified
- Business context and success criteria clearly defined
- Technical constraints and integration points documented

### Technical Planning Standards
- Architecture decisions must be justified and documented
- Technology choices aligned with project constraints and team expertise
- Implementation roadmap with clear phases and dependencies
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies defined

### Task Breakdown Principles
- Tasks sized appropriately (4-8 hours each)
- Test-driven development approach mandatory
- Clear acceptance criteria for each task
- Dependencies mapped to enable parallel execution

### Quality Gates
- 85%+ quality score across all assessment dimensions
- All critical risks identified and mitigated
- Business alignment validated with stakeholders
- Technical feasibility confirmed through analysis

## AI Assistant Integration

The AI assistant operating under this constitution will:
- Follow the 4-phase Spec Kit Assistant methodology
- Maintain context across development phases
- Provide structured, systematic guidance
- Ensure compatibility with existing spec-kit workflows
- Generate comprehensive, actionable artifacts

## Success Criteria

A project following this constitution successfully demonstrates:
- Comprehensive specifications that guide implementation
- Well-architected technical solutions
- Actionable development plans with realistic timelines
- High-quality outcomes validated through systematic analysis
