#### Work Package Analysis Process
```
📦 WORK PACKAGE DEFINITION

Based on your implementation plan, let's organize work into logical packages:

1. Implementation Phase Mapping:
   - What are the major deliverables from your implementation plan?
   - Which deliverables can be worked on independently?
   - What are the natural boundaries for different types of work?

2. Work Package Categories:
   - Infrastructure & Setup: Environment, CI/CD, monitoring, database setup
   - Core Services: Business logic, data access, API endpoints
   - User Interface: Frontend components, user workflows, integration
   - Integration: External APIs, data syncing, event processing
   - Testing & Quality: Test suites, performance testing, security testing
   - Documentation: API docs, deployment guides, user documentation

3. Value-Based Prioritization:
   - Which packages deliver the most user value if completed first?
   - What provides the foundation for other work packages?
   - Where should you validate assumptions early in the process?

4. Risk-Based Sequencing:
   - Which packages have the highest technical uncertainty?
   - What should be built early to reduce project risk?
   - Where are the most critical dependencies?

### Stage 3: Dependency Analysis & Sequencing

#### Dependency Mapping Process
```
🔗 DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS & SEQUENCING

Let's map task dependencies and identify optimization opportunities:

1. Critical Path Identification:
   - Which sequence of tasks determines the minimum project duration?
   - Where are the bottlenecks that could delay the entire project?
   - What tasks have the most dependencies on them?

2. Parallelization Opportunities:
   - Which tasks can be worked on simultaneously by different people?
   - What tasks are completely independent of each other?
   - Where can team members work in parallel without conflicts?

3. Risk-Based Sequencing:
   - Which high-risk tasks should be done early to validate assumptions?
   - What tasks should be completed early to unblock others?
   - Where should you create proof-of-concepts before full implementation?

4. Resource Optimization:
   - How can you balance workload across team members?
   - Which tasks require specific expertise or skills?
   - Where might resource contention create bottlenecks?
```

#### Dependency Analysis Template
```
DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS:

Critical Path Tasks: [T001 → T005 → T012 → T018 → T025]
Project Duration: [X weeks based on critical path]

Parallelization Matrix:
[Tasks that can run in parallel]

Week 1:
- T001 (Setup) + T002 (Database) + T003 (Documentation) ✓ PARALLEL
- Cannot parallel: T004 needs T001 completion

Week 2: 
- T005 (Core API) + T006 (Frontend Setup) ✓ PARALLEL
- Cannot parallel: T007 needs T005 completion

Risk-Based Prioritization:
High Risk, Early Start:
- T008: External API integration (unknown response formats)
- T015: Performance optimization (unproven approach)
- T020: Complex business logic (unclear requirements)

Medium Risk, Standard Timing:
- T010: Database operations (well-understood technology)
- T012: User interface (standard patterns)

Low Risk, Can Be Delayed:
- T025: Documentation updates
- T027: Performance monitoring setup

Resource Allocation:
Backend Developer 1:
- Week 1: T001, T004, T007
- Week 2: T010, T013, T016

Backend Developer 2:
- Week 1: T002, T005, T008
- Week 2: T011, T014, T017

Frontend Developer:
- Week 1: T003, T006
- Week 2: T009, T012, T015

Cross-team Dependencies:
- Frontend needs T007 (API endpoints) by end of Week 1
- Testing needs T010, T011 (core services) by start of Week 3
- Integration needs all services complete by Week 4
```

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tasks Too Large or Vague
**Symptoms**: Tasks that take more than 3 days or have unclear deliverables
**Solution**:
- Break large tasks into smaller, specific subtasks
- Define clear acceptance criteria for each task
- Ensure each task has a single, testable deliverable

### Issue: Dependencies Not Realistic
**Symptoms**: Artificial dependencies or overly complex dependency chains
**Solution**:
- Question whether dependencies are truly necessary
- Look for ways to reduce coupling between tasks
- Create interface contracts to enable parallel development

### Issue: Test Tasks Not Properly Integrated
**Symptoms**: Testing treated as separate activity rather than part of development
**Solution**:
- Embed testing requirements in every implementation task
- Schedule test creation before implementation tasks
- Make test passage a requirement for task completion

### Issue: Resource Allocation Unrealistic
**Symptoms**: Estimates that don't consider team capacity or skill levels
**Solution**:
- Use historical data and team velocity for estimates
- Account for learning curves and skill development needs
- Include realistic buffers for uncertainty and risk

## Next Steps

Once your task breakdown is complete and validated:

1. **Execute Task Generation**: Use your generated prompt with `/tasks` command
2. **Review Generated Tasks**: Validate completeness and feasibility
3. **Refine Task Organization**: Adjust dependencies and sequencing as needed
4. **Begin Implementation**: Start with highest-priority, foundational tasks
5. **Monitor Progress**: Track actual vs. estimated effort for future improvement

The task breakdown becomes your execution roadmap. Ensure it's detailed enough to guide day-to-day development decisions while remaining flexible enough to adapt to discoveries and changes during implementation.
