# Phase 2: AI-Assisted Technical Planning

## Overview

The planning phase transforms your comprehensive specification into a detailed technical implementation roadmap. This phase moves from "what we need to build" to "how we'll build it," covering architecture decisions, technology selection, implementation phases, integration strategies, and risk management.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you will have:
- Clear technical architecture with justified design decisions
- Selected technology stack with rationale for choices
- Detailed implementation phases with dependencies mapped
- Integration strategy for all external systems and data sources
- Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- Comprehensive prompt ready for the `/plan` command

## Phase Structure

### Stage 1: Architecture Foundation (15-20 minutes)
**Objective**: Establish core architecture patterns and design decisions

### Stage 2: Technology Stack Selection (15-20 minutes)
**Objective**: Choose optimal technologies with clear justification

### Stage 3: Implementation Roadmap (15-20 minutes)
**Objective**: Break down development into logical phases with dependencies

## Detailed Stage Guidance

### Stage 1: Architecture Foundation

#### Architecture Exploration Process
```
üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE FOUNDATION ANALYSIS

Based on your specification, let's establish the technical architecture:

1. System Boundaries:
   - What are the main components/modules of this system?
   - How do these components interact with each other?
   - What are the clear boundaries between components?

2. Architecture Patterns:
   - Does this fit a layered architecture? (presentation, business, data)
   - Would microservices be beneficial or overkill?
   - Is this primarily CRUD operations or complex business logic?
   - Are there real-time requirements that affect architecture?

3. Data Architecture:
   - What data needs to be stored vs. computed on-demand?
   - Are there different data access patterns (read-heavy vs. write-heavy)?
   - Do you need caching layers? Where and what type?
   - Are there data consistency requirements across components?

4. Scalability Considerations:
   - What are the growth projections (users, data, requests)?
   - Which components might become bottlenecks first?
   - How will you handle increased load (vertical vs. horizontal scaling)?
```

#### Architecture Decision Framework
```
ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORD TEMPLATE:

Decision: [Specific architectural choice]
Status: [Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated]
Context: [Business and technical context that influences this decision]

Options Considered:
1. Option A: [Description] 
   - Pros: [Benefits and advantages]
   - Cons: [Drawbacks and limitations]
   - Trade-offs: [What we gain vs. what we lose]

2. Option B: [Description]
   - Pros: [Benefits and advantages]
   - Cons: [Drawbacks and limitations]
   - Trade-offs: [What we gain vs. what we lose]

Decision: [Chosen option with clear rationale]
Consequences: [Expected impact on development, maintenance, performance]
```

#### Common Architecture Patterns Assessment
```
PATTERN SUITABILITY ANALYSIS:

Layered Architecture:
‚úÖ Good for: Clear separation of concerns, traditional CRUD applications
‚ùå Avoid if: Need high performance, complex business workflows, real-time processing

Microservices:
‚úÖ Good for: Independent scaling, team autonomy, diverse technology needs
‚ùå Avoid if: Small team, simple application, tight coupling between features

Event-Driven:
‚úÖ Good for: Real-time updates, loose coupling, audit trails
‚ùå Avoid if: Simple workflows, strong consistency requirements, debugging complexity concerns

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):
‚úÖ Good for: Different read/write patterns, high-performance reads, complex business logic
‚ùå Avoid if: Simple CRUD operations, small scale, additional complexity not justified

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue: Technology Choices Not Justified
**Symptoms**: Selecting technologies based on preference rather than requirements
**Solution**: 
- Create evaluation matrix with weighted criteria
- Document trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Align technology characteristics with specification requirements

### Issue: Implementation Phases Too Large
**Symptoms**: Phases that take more than 2-3 weeks or deliver no user value
**Solution**:
- Break large phases into smaller, value-delivering increments
- Ensure each phase has demonstrable user-facing functionality
- Create clear dependencies between phases

### Issue: Integration Complexity Underestimated
**Symptoms**: Simple assumptions about external system connections
**Solution**:
- Research actual API documentation and constraints
- Plan for authentication, rate limiting, and error scenarios
- Include integration testing and monitoring requirements

### Issue: Risks Not Specific Enough
**Symptoms**: Generic risks like "project might be delayed"
**Solution**:
- Identify specific failure modes and their causes
- Quantify probability and impact where possible
- Create actionable mitigation strategies with owners

## Next Steps

Once your planning prompt is complete and validated:

1. **Execute the Plan**: Use your generated prompt with `/plan` command
2. **Review Generated Plan**: Validate technical feasibility and completeness
3. **Iterate if Needed**: Refine architectural or technology decisions
4. **Transition to Tasks**: Move to Phase 3 with `/spec-kit-assistant tasks`

The technical plan you create becomes the blueprint for all implementation work. Ensure it's thorough, realistic, and provides clear guidance for the development team.
