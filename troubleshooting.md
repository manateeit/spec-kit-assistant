# Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview

This comprehensive troubleshooting guide addresses common issues, performance problems, and workflow challenges encountered when using the Spec Kit Assistant. Each issue includes symptom identification, root cause analysis, step-by-step resolution procedures, and prevention strategies.

## Quick Diagnostic Checklist

### System Health Check
```bash
# Verify system components
1. Check session state integrity: /spec-kit-assistant status
2. Validate template availability: List available templates
3. Confirm AI model accessibility: Test basic prompt generation
4. Verify file system permissions: Check .spec-kit-assistant/ directory
5. Test state persistence: Create and restore test session
```

### Common Warning Signs
- ⚠️ **Session Recovery Failures**: State corruption or incomplete checkpoints
- ⚠️ **Low Quality Scores**: Generated prompts consistently scoring below 70/100
- ⚠️ **Prompt Generation Errors**: Template rendering failures or incomplete outputs
- ⚠️ **Workflow Progression Issues**: Phase transition validation failures
- ⚠️ **Performance Degradation**: Slow response times or timeout errors

## Critical Issues and Resolutions

### Issue 1: Session State Corruption
**Symptoms**:
- Session fails to load with validation errors
- Inconsistent phase progression status
- Missing or corrupted artifacts
- Checkpoint recovery failures

**Root Causes**:
- Concurrent session modifications
- Unexpected system shutdown during state persistence
- File system permission issues
- Schema version incompatibilities

**Resolution Steps**:
```bash
1. Attempt automatic recovery:
   /spec-kit-assistant status --recovery-mode

2. If automatic recovery fails, restore from latest checkpoint:
   - Navigate to .spec-kit-assistant/sessions/[session-id]/checkpoints/
   - Identify latest valid checkpoint file
   - Execute: /spec-kit-assistant restore --checkpoint [checkpoint-id]

3. If checkpoint recovery fails, perform manual state reconstruction:
   - Export surviving artifacts from session directory
   - Create new session with same project context
   - Import recovered artifacts manually
   - Resume workflow from last successful phase

4. Prevention measures:
   - Enable automatic checkpoint creation every 15 minutes
   - Implement state validation before each persistence operation
   - Set up regular session state backups
```

**Advanced Debugging**:
```javascript
// State validation script
async function validateSessionIntegrity(sessionId) {
    const state = await loadRawState(sessionId);
    
    // Schema validation
    const schemaErrors = validateStateSchema(state);
    if (schemaErrors.length > 0) {
        console.log('Schema validation errors:', schemaErrors);
    }
    
    // Business logic validation
    const logicErrors = validateBusinessLogic(state);
    if (logicErrors.length > 0) {
        console.log('Business logic errors:', logicErrors);
    }
    
    // Cross-reference validation
    const consistencyErrors = validateDataConsistency(state);
    if (consistencyErrors.length > 0) {
        console.log('Data consistency errors:', consistencyErrors);
    }
    
    return {
        isValid: schemaErrors.length === 0 && logicErrors.length === 0 && consistencyErrors.length === 0,
        errors: [...schemaErrors, ...logicErrors, ...consistencyErrors]
    };
}
```

### Issue 2: Low-Quality Prompt Generation
