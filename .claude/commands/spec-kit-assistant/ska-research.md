# Spec Kit Assistant - Codebase Research

I'm now in **Codebase Research** mode, analyzing your existing project to understand its architecture, identify improvement opportunities, and recommend features for the Spec Kit development process.

## üîç Research Objectives

I'll systematically analyze your codebase to provide:

### Architecture Discovery
- **Technology Stack**: Identify frameworks, libraries, and development patterns
- **Project Structure**: Understand component organization and data flow
- **Dependencies**: Map internal and external system relationships
- **Design Patterns**: Recognize architectural approaches and conventions

### Feature Analysis
- **Existing Features**: Catalog current functionality and user capabilities
- **Code Quality**: Assess maintainability, test coverage, and technical debt
- **Performance Patterns**: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Security Posture**: Evaluate authentication, authorization, and data protection

### Enhancement Opportunities
- **Missing Features**: Identify gaps in user experience or functionality
- **Modernization Candidates**: Legacy code suitable for refactoring
- **Integration Possibilities**: External system connection opportunities
- **User Experience Improvements**: UI/UX enhancement recommendations

## üìä Analysis Depth

${1 ? `Analysis Depth: **${1}**` : 'I\'ll determine optimal analysis depth based on codebase size and complexity.'}

**Available Depth Levels:**
- **quick** - High-level overview and immediate opportunities (15-20 minutes)
- **standard** - Comprehensive analysis with detailed recommendations (30-45 minutes)
- **deep** - Thorough investigation including dependency analysis (1-2 hours)
- **audit** - Complete codebase audit with security and performance assessment (2-4 hours)

## üîß Research Process

### Phase 1: Codebase Discovery
I'll systematically explore your project structure:

1. **Project Overview**
   - Examine package.json, requirements.txt, or similar configuration files
   - Identify main entry points and application structure
   - Map directory organization and naming conventions

2. **Technology Assessment**
   - Catalog frameworks, libraries, and development tools
   - Analyze version currency and compatibility
   - Identify architectural patterns and design approaches

3. **Code Quality Analysis**
   - Assess test coverage and testing strategies
   - Review documentation completeness
   - Identify technical debt and maintenance issues

### Phase 2: Feature Mapping
I'll catalog existing functionality and identify opportunities:

1. **Current Feature Inventory**
   - Map user-facing features and capabilities
   - Document API endpoints and data models
   - Identify business logic and workflow patterns

2. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare features against modern application standards
   - Identify user experience pain points
   - Find missing integrations or automation opportunities

3. **Enhancement Prioritization**
   - Rank improvement opportunities by impact and effort
   - Identify quick wins and strategic initiatives
   - Map features suitable for spec-driven development

### Phase 3: Spec Kit Recommendations
I'll provide actionable recommendations for your development roadmap:

1. **High-Priority Features**
   - Features that would significantly improve user experience
   - Technical improvements that reduce maintenance burden
   - Security or performance enhancements

2. **Spec Kit Candidates**
   - Complex features that benefit from systematic specification
   - Features requiring cross-team coordination
   - User-facing improvements needing stakeholder alignment

3. **Development Roadmap**
   - Suggested implementation order based on dependencies
   - Resource requirements and timeline estimates
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## üìã Research Deliverables

I'll provide comprehensive documentation including:

### Executive Summary
- Key findings and strategic recommendations
- Technology stack assessment and modernization opportunities
- Priority feature recommendations with business impact

### Technical Analysis Report
- Architecture overview with visual diagrams
- Code quality metrics and improvement areas
- Security and performance assessment findings

### Feature Recommendation Matrix
- Prioritized list of enhancement opportunities
- Effort/impact analysis for each recommendation  
- Detailed specifications for high-priority items

### Spec Kit Development Plan
- Features ready for `/ska-start` specification development
- Suggested development phases and dependencies
- Integration with existing development workflows

## üöÄ Getting Started

I'll begin by examining your project structure and configuration files to understand the current state.

**Let me start the research process:**

1. **Project Structure Analysis** - Understanding your codebase organization
2. **Technology Stack Discovery** - Identifying frameworks and dependencies
3. **Feature Mapping** - Cataloging existing functionality
4. **Opportunity Identification** - Finding enhancement possibilities
5. **Recommendation Synthesis** - Prioritizing improvements for spec-driven development

## üìÅ What I'll Examine

- Configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Source code structure and organization
- Database schemas and data models
- API endpoints and service interfaces
- User interface components and workflows
- Testing strategies and coverage
- Documentation and README files
- Deployment and infrastructure configuration
