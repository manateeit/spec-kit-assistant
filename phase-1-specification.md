# Phase 1: AI-Assisted Specification Development

## Overview

The specification phase is the foundation of successful spec-driven development. Instead of creating basic requirement documents, this phase uses AI-guided exploration to produce comprehensive, detailed prompts that generate thorough specifications covering all aspects of user needs, business context, technical constraints, and success criteria.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you will have:
- A comprehensive understanding of your feature's purpose and scope
- Detailed user journey mappings with edge cases identified
- Clear business context and success metrics defined
- Technical constraints and integration requirements documented
- A high-quality prompt ready for the `/specify` command

## Phase Structure

### Stage 1: Core Idea Exploration (10-15 minutes)
**Objective**: Transform a basic idea into a clear, focused concept

### Stage 2: User Journey Deep Dive (15-20 minutes)  
**Objective**: Map complete user workflows with scenarios and edge cases

### Stage 3: Business Context Analysis (10-15 minutes)
**Objective**: Establish business value, metrics, and constraints

### Stage 4: Technical Landscape Assessment (10-15 minutes)
**Objective**: Identify integration points, performance needs, and limitations

### Stage 5: Success Criteria Definition (10-15 minutes)
**Objective**: Create testable, measurable acceptance criteria

### Stage 6: Comprehensive Prompt Generation (5-10 minutes)
**Objective**: Synthesize all insights into a detailed `/specify` prompt

## Detailed Stage Guidance

### Stage 1: Core Idea Exploration

#### AI Assistant Approach
```
I need to understand your core concept clearly before we can build comprehensive requirements. Let's start with some focused questions:

üéØ CORE CONCEPT EXPLORATION

1. Basic Description:
   - In one sentence, what does this feature do?
   - What problem does it solve for users?

2. Primary Purpose:
   - Why is this needed now?
   - What happens if we don't build this?

3. Initial Scope:
   - Is this a new feature or enhancement to existing functionality?
   - How does it fit into the broader system?

Take your time with these - good specifications start with crystal clear purpose.
```

#### Quality Checkpoints
- [ ] Purpose is clear and compelling
- [ ] Problem statement is specific, not vague
- [ ] Scope boundaries are defined
- [ ] Business need is articulated

#### Common Issues and Solutions
**Issue**: Vague problem statements like "users need better dashboards"
**Solution**: Drill down with "What specific tasks are users struggling with? What decisions can't they make with current information?"

**Issue**: Solution-focused descriptions like "we need a React dashboard"
**Solution**: Redirect to user needs: "What user problems would this dashboard solve? What workflows would it enable?"

### Stage 2: User Journey Deep Dive

#### AI Assistant Guided Exploration
```
üìù USER JOURNEY MAPPING

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue: Vague or Generic Requirements
**Symptoms**: Requirements like "easy to use," "fast performance," "good interface"
**Solution**: 
- Ask for specific, measurable criteria
- Use the "How would you know?" questioning technique
- Provide concrete examples and ask for user preferences

### Issue: Solution-Focused Rather Than Problem-Focused
**Symptoms**: Requirements specify implementation details instead of user needs
**Solution**:
- Redirect to user problems and goals
- Ask "Why is this specific approach needed?"
- Focus on outcomes rather than methods

### Issue: Missing Edge Cases
**Symptoms**: Only happy path scenarios are considered
**Solution**:
- Systematically explore each edge case category
- Use "What if?" questioning technique
- Consider real-world operational scenarios

### Issue: Unmeasurable Success Criteria
**Symptoms**: Success criteria that can't be validated or measured
**Solution**:
- Ask for specific metrics and thresholds
- Connect criteria to business outcomes
- Ensure all criteria are testable

## Templates and Examples

### Dashboard/Analytics Feature Example
```
Feature: Executive Revenue Dashboard

Core Functionality:
- Displays monthly revenue trends with year-over-year comparison
- Shows revenue breakdown by product line, region, and customer segment
- Provides drill-down capability from summary to transaction detail
- Enables export of data in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV)

User Journey:
1. Executive opens dashboard ‚Üí Sees current month revenue summary
2. Compares to targets ‚Üí Identifies performance gaps
3. Drills down to product lines ‚Üí Identifies specific issues
4. Exports data ‚Üí Shares with team for analysis

Edge Cases:
- No data available for current month (show previous month with warning)
- Data is delayed (show last update timestamp)
- User lacks permissions for certain segments (show available data only)

Success Criteria:
- Dashboard loads in < 3 seconds for 95% of requests
- 80% of executives use dashboard weekly within 30 days
- Data export functionality used by 60% of users
```

### API Integration Feature Example
```
Feature: Customer Data Sync API

Core Functionality:
- Synchronizes customer data between CRM and billing systems
- Handles incremental updates every 15 minutes
- Provides real-time sync capability for critical updates
- Maintains data consistency across systems

User Journey:
1. CRM user updates customer record ‚Üí System detects change
2. Change is validated ‚Üí API sync is triggered
3. Billing system is updated ‚Üí Confirmation is logged
4. User sees sync status ‚Üí Can verify update completed

Edge Cases:
- CRM system unavailable (queue changes for later sync)
- Billing system rejects update (retry with exponential backoff)
- Conflicting updates from both systems (last-write-wins with audit)

Success Criteria:
- 99.5% of syncs complete successfully
- Average sync latency < 30 seconds
- Zero data loss during system failures
```

## Next Steps

Once your specification prompt is complete and validated:

1. **Execute the Specification**: Use your generated prompt with `/specify` command
2. **Review Generated Specification**: Validate the output meets quality standards
3. **Iterate if Needed**: Refine the prompt based on specification quality
4. **Transition to Planning**: Move to Phase 2 with `/spec-kit-assistant plan`

The specification you create in this phase becomes the foundation for all subsequent development work. Invest the time to make it comprehensive and clear - it will pay dividends throughout the entire development lifecycle.
